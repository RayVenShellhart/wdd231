            <h2>What are Monitors</h2>
            <p>Monitors displays information that is processed by a graphics cards and sent from a computer. 
                They are similar to TVs however have a much greater resilution and pixel density. There are many types of monitors from the original 
                "Cathode ray tube" or charset to the newer "Organic Light-Emiting Diode" or OLED, 4k and curved formats, and widescreen and different heights.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="pixel">
            <h2>Pixels</h2>
            <p>As stated previously previously a computer runs data through a graphics card and then sends the data to the monitor. Once it reaches said monitor it tells it 
                tells the pixels what to do. Pixels are are what make up the monitors screen and there are thousands of them.
                Each pixel has three subpixels that are red, green and blue. Using the data each pixels glow at a certain intensity to create an image.
                Monitors then refresh the data from top to bottom at a certain rate called Hertz (Hz). The most common minimium a monitor can have and the general default is
                60Hz. For things like gaming 100-120Hz is more common. For those more serious about 240-360Hz can be seen. However the highest available today goes to about
                500hz while some monitors that are being showcased that can reach 1,000. For reference the average human sees at about 30-60hz per second. The fastest seeing animal, the dragonfly,
                can see up to 300hz. That means it the refresh rate moves so fast that at some of the lower rates we can't even perceive it.

        <section class="types">
            <h2>Types</h2>
            <p>
                There are multiple types of monitors like the CRT. However the CRT is outdated so these days there are three different types that are commonly used instead: LCD, LED, and OLED.
            </p>
            <h3>LCD</h3>
            <p>The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) places two layers of liquid crystals between glass or plastic, with backlight, to
            diplay images. The crystals
            line up when eletricty is applied, controlling the light giving different images. Click on the LCD image to learn more!</p>
            <h3>LED</h3>
            <p>LED's (Light-Emiting Diode) are a type of LCD However have improved capabilities compared to a normal one. Click ond the LED image to learn more!</p>
            <h3>OLED</h3>
            <p>OLED (Organic Light-Emiting Diode) monitors instead of using liquid crystal use organic compounds to emit light when introduced to an eletric current. Unlike LCD's 
                OLED's pixels are self-illuminating meaning no backlight. This allows for perfect colors and contrast. It also allows for perfect black levels (The backlight of others produces a small glow),
                perfect response times, and vibrant colors. Click on the OLED image to learn more!

        <section class="formats">
            <h2>Formats</h2>
            <p>There are many different formats a monitor can be and not just one. A monitor can have many different types. They are truly a mix and match</p>
            <h3>Touchscreen</h3>
            <p>These monitors have the capability to be interacted with through touch. This technology is most often apparent in phones, kiosks and any display 
                that is interactive. These often are ideal for creative and interactive applications.
            </p>
            <h3>Curved</h3>
            <p>Curved monitors a curve applied to the screen. Some more dramatic than others, these monitors allow for a more immersive viewing expierence as it improves viewing angles.
                These are most often used for movies, gaming and design work.
            </p>
            <h3>Ultrawide</h3>
            <p>These monitors are wider than the average ratio and offer more space for work, multitasking, or immersiveness. Ideal for poeple who need more screen space.
                These monitors pair well with curved.
            </p>
            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>These monitors are made specifically for High-performance gaming, producing technologies that improve that average expierence.
                These often sync better with games for a smoother expierence. However they are often more expensive.
